# Advent Of Code 2021

My personal solutions for the challenge of https://adventofcode.com/ for the year 2021

## Requirements
- Node

## Execute solution
```
node day1

// or

node day1/index.js
```

## Project sctructure
Each folder represents a day.

Inside there is a **index.js** that usually have the solutions of part 1 and part 2. Also exists a file **input.txt** that contains the example input of the problem.

Some solutions contains more than one file. For example day 3 have the solution in a recursive approach inside the **recursive.js** of that file.
